    "# 1. Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- The kinds of words that genuine employees use in glassdoor review is different from the one used by HR.\n",
    "- So my theory is that I can use AI to distinguist between these two kind of reviews.\n",
    "- This will be achived using embeddings. An embedding is a coversion of natural language to vectors. Vectors of similar words are close to each other. My theory is that one or more regions of of the vector space are more of the human resources kind while other regions are more of the genuine employee kinds.\n",
    "- My goal is to train a neural network to identify regions in the vector space that are \"hr\"-ish vs. regions that are \"genuine\"-ish. Based on this, given a review text, the network will be able to predict if the review was written by HR or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training data consists of pros, cons, overall review, sounds like hr\n",
    "- pros, cons represented as vector embeddings using openai api\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: How is the `sounds_like_hr` field set in the training data? The answer is that I set it based on my gut instinct! **Please do not take this project seriously**, it's just an excuse to try out machine learning algorithms. For context: I used Glassdoor in the past and suspected some reviews were written by HR; either because they would say there are no cons or they would pander to the company like 'you have to work late, but it's worth it'. I thought it would be a fun project to build an AI that could detect this based on my instinct rather than emperical data."

He avoided key concerns and told everyone they would needed to write their own KPIâs and that a company wide bonus will be âlooked intoâ for 2020, as well as answering a question on company culture and staff turnover with figures and an off topic answer on customer journey. \\n\\nFurther to this our new CEO has a closed door policy at all times... you will find him in his glass office, disinterested in what everyone else is working on. He isnât visible within the business, doesnât like to be challenged and currently isnât leading and inspiring the company staff. The top line management team also gives off the impression that they donât know whatâs going on which is adding to the demotivating atmosphere within the office. \\n\\nIn light of the above, HR/Management need to implement some quick fixes to improve communication and bring back the company culture we all once loved before we loose any more key talented people! \\n\\nThe following also needs to be reviewed ASAP: Company wide bonus - sooner than 2021 payout, Incentives and rewards - bring back thank you pizzas, company credit, etc, \\nKPIs - without these what are we basing bonus and promotions on?  Low salaries - HR were working on a benchmarking project 6+ months ago yet nothing has been discussed since,  1 Flight per year - this has been in discussion for over 2 years now, company credit on your birthday - parent company employees get this yet company staff donât? Also we need Effective training programmes introduced.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This review is not meant as an attack on people or coming from a place of anger. This is purely so anyone applying to company can go in with open eyes and understand the current situation at company. Rather than a personal attack, it is more of a case that the wrong people have been put in the wrong jobs and previous experience has not been accounted for when hiring. \\n\\n\\nNow where to even start..\\n\\nThe cons all stem from the leadership team, two people in particular.\\nThe first is the CEO. There are two main problems here, his ego and that he actually has no power to make any decisions.\\nPrevious employees have worked incredibly hard over the years to build fantastic and close-knit relationships with some of the biggest brands in fashion. However, one quick meeting between the brand and the company CEO can jeopardise that in as little as 15 minutes. His ego, lack of respect for anyone else and âcompany is bigger than any other brandâ attitude, immediately destroys the mutual and strong partnerships thatâs previously existed. \\n\\nDespite the title of CEO, the CEO has little power within the business. Instead, you will go back and forth on decisions, be asked to always âprovide more informationâ, so he can bide his time as he isnât actually sure what to do, or able to make the decision himself, before this is then decided by the chairman. The issue here is that decisions about the business are being made by people who are not involved in the day to day running of the company and heads of departments are not consulted, and so as you can imagine, more often than not, the wrong decisions are made. \\n\\nTo hide the fact the CEO and CCO are unsure how to run the company and out of their depth, they have come up with a strategy. They are now slowly but surely allowing talented and experienced individuals leave and replacing them with timid and inexperienced people who become âyes menâ for them. The teams under these new middle managers are left frustrated that they are now answering to people with less experience than them and with no backbone to stick up for the teams when needed. A simple look at the HR team will prove this point. The HR function may as well not exist in this company. \\nMarketing is completely understaffed to the point where I am not sure you can call it a marketing department anymore. Jobs such as copy writing, an essential element to the business do not have a team and no importance is put on such a function when looking at team structure or hiring. \\nThe structures in all departments are also very top heavy. Within most teams, senior members of staff have been hired and there is little importance put on the more junior roles, even though these are the typically the ones doing the majority of the day to day work and ensuring the business is running. \\n\\nFor those left with experience and with opinions, they are fighting a constant battle. For example, working with the CCO is nothing short of impossible. Despite having absolutely zero experience in running an online fashion company, he does not listen to the teams underneath him who have worked in this field their entire careers. If someone will push back on a task that they do not believe has substance or makes sense for the business they are told it is JFD (this means just do it, with other insulting words thrown in). Yes, this really is how a CCO speaks to staff at this company. \\n\\nOverall, the team are demotivated and over worked. They are demotivated as their leadership team has little or no experience and over worked as majority of the people who have left have not been replaced or replaced with someone who is more of a hindrance than a help. There is no respect for peopleâs personal time. Staff are expected to work 24/7 with trivial phone calls coming through at midnight.</td>\n",

       "      <td>cons: -Work Culture - There's no work culture to be honest. People are fired who object to Senior Management decisions/talks. Company is sales centric though it fakes itself to show people centric to employees.  There's no chemistry in the work culture. No one works to put their heart into company/work. People come, people work and they go back home when its time to leave. Everyone works in-silo. Zero coordination between teams and no one goes out of their way to help out people.\\n\\nA lot of effort is spent on generation of fake PR while in actual the technology wing sucks bad. There are no HR policies and people have been fired in past citing performance related reasons while in actual there's no performance evaluation system in place. People are fired and exit the company behind back doors. You only get to know on their last working day.\\n\\nMiddle Management: One of the main reasons why this company is not a good place to work is because of 0 empowerment. The decisions are trickled from Senior leadership -&gt; Bottom employees. Middle managers are the distributors of work and their view point is not at all taken into account (few are very close and trusted by leadership - The branding likeables). Key and critical decisions are taken behind doors and then forced upon employees. \\n\\nQuarterly meetings have awards given to random people which is decided in last 15-20 mins before the meetings. \\n\\nTechnology- Technology teams are struggling badly. Some people have been brought from top employers and they are treated like Gods from heaven. There are people who are paid 2X,3X or even 5X just because they are poached from Top employers. They expect innovation and high productivity from these 5% of individuals. Theyâve created an empire/hierarchy similar to historic era when Kings ruled the poor/farmers/needy people. The poor/farmers/needy people are the cost based hiring which they did initially and the wealthy are the recent recruits who are asked to rule them. Their product has numerous bugs and hardly anyone is Tech savvy in products/engineering teams. Hiring is totally random. You would see a core technical person poor in ethics/cultural point of view. Or a poor technical person with good work ethics and politeness. So everything is random. \\n\\nCompany lacks heart and is struggling with its both Mission and Vision statement. \\nMaybe its on a path to get acquired. All these factors contribute to an average company which is on a path to either become acquired or go extinct. Company is shown in media as very cool and tech centric but this is all fake. This is not where you would grow professionally as there are hardly any leaders in company.\\nOther co-founder is constantly chasing people to fill good reviews on Glassdoor :D.

Almost all of the companys now from the same country, absolutely no diversity anymore. Big shame watching such a great company go this way. Everyone either leaving or being pushed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>cons: The whole company went downhill after the parent company takeover last year. parent company have totally destroyed the company, it has been sad to watch. Everybody was either pushed or jumped ship. One day they actually called the whole company together and offered 6 weeks pay on top of notice period to leave and not come back. They got rid of all the Heads of Function and brought in parent company replacements to make sure that there was no one we could go and talk to for advice or concerns. Now the company has a really poor reputation in the market, as they don't respect brands or market practice, it's all parent company principles now. And even the delivery times are slow since they brought this function inhouse, which used to be the main selling point. The parent company CEO doesn't have the slightest bit of business acumen, HR \"people director\" is beyond useless again another example of promoting someone with no qualifications or meaningful experience, who will nod their heads and contribute very little. The management they brought in to company are hopeless and just out for themselves. Staff discount isn't as good as it was and to be honest this was the main benefit of working there. The few of us that are still left, we hoped things would settle down, but they didn't. We are all just trying to leave and find something better.</td>\n",

Late night calls dragging you out of bed at 3-4 AM, not just once but several times a weekâ¦ or night. The overall mentality of the company showed little little regard for employee well-being. Working weekends was encouraged, and blurring boundaries between personal life and work was celebrated. parent company's leadership seemed to take pride in how they could push you to work around the clock.Training and Teamwork: Mostly Missing\\nCertain senior colleagues were ill-mannered and exhibited condescending attitude. Needing support? Expect to be looked down upon with all charm of a grumpy old-school headmaster.Leadership: An Inspiration... to leave \\nFrom mid-level management to very top, it was parade of uninspiring figures who excelled at putting unconstructive pressure on employees. parent company's leadership strategy: believe that employees are like machinesâjust push harder, and theyâll work faster only. Constant urgency created an atmosphere where panic was primary motivator. Just apply enough pressure, and stressed-out employees make mistakes faster than they can fix. Itâs almost as if they thought that by cranking up the stress levels, they could squeeze out extra productivity. But hey, at least they managed to turn urgency into an artâjust not the kind that results in anything usefulâ¦\\n\\nReorgs and Appraisals: Constant Fear\\nReorgs were frequent, often feeling like imminent threat of being fired. Every reorg was like waiting for axe to fall, creating atmosphere of constant fear and insecurity. Appraisal cycles were no better, more a ritual of dread than a constructive review, ensuring everyone stayed on edge.\\n\\nEmployee Retention: Always hiring!\\nHigh attrition rate. I know teams that lost 4 out of 6 employees in less than two years. True testament of companyâs work experience.\\n\\nToxic Environment: âSpeak Upââ¦ at Your Peril\\nCompleting anonymous surveys can land you in managementâs bad books. Rather than viewing feedback as tool for improvement, management preferred to play detective, trying to unmask brave souls who dared to voice negativity.

Nobody knows who runs company currently. not even the employees who are working there . every month some random person from parent company will take their laptop and come and start working for company. No announcements are made even for major structural changes.. like if a new GM has joined &amp; old GM was fired. You will not even know. the old GM will suddenly vanish one fine morning . they will not even give you chance for a proper sendoff. Employees are supposed to guess who is doing what . No communication with the team . suddenly some random posters will comeup in office with some crazy targets. without knowing the ground reality &amp; no one from the team who is actually supposed to achieve these targets will have any idea on what these are or how to achieve these as they were not even consulted before setting these targets. The management has so much EGO , they are arrogant , Egotistical , Disrespectful &amp; promote toxic work culture, The parent company CEO promotes a work culture where he praises a person who was replying to emails from the labor room while giving birth . in second example he praises a guy working at 4 am in the morning with his new born son on his lap on the day his son was born. !! how on earth is this a good thing ? you are certainly out of your mind if you create an environment , where employees are forced to work on these conditions. imagine the fear they have created that if you dont work like this you will be fired. would you like to work for a company or leader who promotes this kind of toxic work culture ? They think that all company employees are idiots ,they dont know how to do their jobs and should be fired. These are the exact words which were used by the parent company CEO on the 1st day of new office in front of the whole office. imagine the motivation of team members after that. They do exactly opposite of what they say in front of you. they said all company employees jobs will be safe. and the 1st thing they did was fired all the good performing employees &amp; replaced them with their own puppets who dont even know anything about running an online fashion company.

The company culture, frankly, is not conducive to inclusivity. Women are not given due attention, they are often interrupted during discussions, and promotions are less accessible to them, reminiscent of the situation in the U.S. several decades ago. Leadership lacks diversity, consisting mainly of middle-aged men from the MENA region with consulting backgrounds. This is not how you build a culture that fosters diverse perspectives and challenges the status quo. There's also an unnecessary urgency attached to everything, often resulting from inadequate planning, which is a breeding ground for mistakes. The structure is problematic too, with a top-heavy senior leadership, followed by a gap, and then a group of young individuals who may not yet fully understand professional life, yet are eager for significant titles. Mid-level management seems to be populated with individuals who simply comply, managed tightly by the leadership and spending significant time handling subpar talent. The engineering department is subpar and under-resourced, and the CTO, who spent his prime years at a more traditional company, seems to lack an understanding of the current landscape. In terms of user base, none of our products exceed half a million users. Uber took over our primary business, assimilated it, and the remainder has been largely abandoned.

    "We do see some instances of this in the table e.g. \"no cons\" , \"Few peoples are not working hard they will down value of company and team members.\" It's difficult to conclude because the test set only contained 7 reviews that seemed like they were written by HR. Should repeat this experiment with a larger data sample.\n",

    "What we also see is that HR cons section tend to shorter than genuine ones, and frequently share the pr-friendly con \"long hours, startups are choatic\" e.t.c . We only considered the \"cons\" field, but when we combine this with the rating field, I feel that an AI model would be able to pick up on these differences and therefore be able to classify a review that looks like it was written by HR.\n",
