    "# 1. Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- The kinds of words that genuine employees use in glassdoor review is different from the one used by HR.\n",
    "- So my theory is that I can use AI to distinguist between these two kind of reviews.\n",
    "- This will be achived using embeddings. An embedding is a coversion of natural language to vectors. Vectors of similar words are close to each other. My theory is that one or more regions of of the vector space are more of the human resources kind while other regions are more of the genuine employee kinds.\n",
    "- My goal is to train a neural network to identify regions in the vector space that are \"hr\"-ish vs. regions that are \"genuine\"-ish. Based on this, given a review text, the network will be able to predict if the review was written by HR or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training data consists of pros, cons, overall review, sounds like hr\n",
    "- pros, cons represented as vector embeddings using openai api\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: How is the `sounds_like_hr` field set in the training data? The answer is that I set it based on my gut instinct! **Please do not take this project seriously**, it's just an excuse to try out machine learning algorithms. For context: I used Glassdoor in the past and suspected some reviews were written by HR; either because they would say there are no cons or they would pander to the company like 'you have to work late, but it's worth it'. I thought it would be a fun project to build an AI that could detect this based on my instinct rather than emperical data."

    "We do see some instances of this in the table e.g. \"no cons\" , \"Few peoples are not working hard they will down value of company and team members.\" It's difficult to conclude because the test set only contained 7 reviews that seemed like they were written by HR. Should repeat this experiment with a larger data sample.\n",

    "What we also see is that HR cons section tend to shorter than genuine ones, and frequently share the pr-friendly con \"long hours, startups are choatic\" e.t.c . We only considered the \"cons\" field, but when we combine this with the rating field, I feel that an AI model would be able to pick up on these differences and therefore be able to classify a review that looks like it was written by HR.\n",
