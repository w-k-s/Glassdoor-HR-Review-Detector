    "- The kinds of words that genuine employees use in glassdoor review is different from the one used by HR.\n",
    "- So my theory is that I can use AI to distinguist between these two kind of reviews.\n",
    "- This will be achived using embeddings. An embedding is a coversion of natural language to vectors. Vectors of similar words are close to each other. My theory is that one or more regions of of the vector space are more of the human resources kind while other regions are more of the genuine employee kinds.\n",
    "- My goal is to train a neural network to identify regions in the vector space that are \"hr\"-ish vs. regions that are \"genuine\"-ish. Based on this, given a review text, the network will be able to predict if the review was written by HR or not.\n",
