empReview_17745802,"Nov 6, 2017",1.0,"Summary of the review-
If you are coming from an average employer of experience between 1-2 years-
Go for it for an year and then move on. Focus on improving your professional skills and groom them and then move on. Company has a good brand value and it should stay like this for another year (maximum - 2018 end). It will add value to your profile/resume.

If you are coming from a Top employer / Top college - They will try to lure you by benefits/money. Don't be lured. It will be a drop in your career. You won't grow professionally and why do you want to bring negativity in your system. This company might destroy your energy and your viewpoint about startups. You don't want to be here. Trust me.

+ Brand value of company is good in Middle East with its recent success in funding
+ Can be a good learning experience for someone between 1-3 years of experience. Note- Good learning experience for 1 year. After that it drops steeply.
+If you role is direct reporting to CEO/CFO/Senior Leadership, and you have a direct transparency of your work, you can grow faster if you know how to brand yourself
+Good to join for a small time and then you can switch to a better employer/startup like Careem","-Work Culture - There's no work culture to be honest. People are fired who object to Senior Management decisions/talks. Company is sales centric though it fakes itself to show people centric to employees.  There's no chemistry in the work culture. No one works to put their heart into company/work. People come, people work and they go back home when its time to leave. Everyone works in-silo. Zero coordination between teams and no one goes out of their way to help out people.

A lot of effort is spent on generation of fake PR while in actual the technology wing sucks bad. There are no HR policies and people have been fired in past citing performance related reasons while in actual there's no performance evaluation system in place. People are fired and exit the company behind back doors. You only get to know on their last working day.

Middle Management: One of the main reasons why this company is not a good place to work is because of 0 empowerment. The decisions are trickled from Senior leadership -> Bottom employees. Middle managers are the distributors of work and their view point is not at all taken into account (few are very close and trusted by leadership - The branding likeables). Key and critical decisions are taken behind doors and then forced upon employees. 

Quarterly meetings have awards given to random people which is decided in last 15-20 mins before the meetings. 

Technology- Technology teams are struggling badly. Some people have been brought from top employers and they are treated like Gods from heaven. There are people who are paid 2X,3X or even 5X just because they are poached from Top employers. They expect innovation and high productivity from these 5% of individuals. Theyâ€™ve created an empire/hierarchy similar to historic era when Kings ruled the poor/farmers/needy people. The poor/farmers/needy people are the cost based hiring which they did initially and the wealthy are the recent recruits who are asked to rule them. Their product has numerous bugs and hardly anyone is Tech savvy in products/engineering teams. Hiring is totally random. You would see a core technical person poor in ethics/cultural point of view. Or a poor technical person with good work ethics and politeness. So everything is random. 

Company lacks heart and is struggling with its both Mission and Vision statement. 
Maybe its on a path to get acquired. All these factors contribute to an average company which is on a path to either become acquired or go extinct. Company is shown in media as very cool and tech centric but this is all fake. This is not where you would grow professionally as there are hardly any leaders in company.
Other co-founder is constantly chasing people to fill good reviews on Glassdoor :D. You can read other reviews about it on Glassdoor as well.",0
