empReview_17745802,"Nov 6, 2017",1.0,"Summary of the review-
If you are coming from an average employer of experience between 1-2 years-
Go for it for an year and then move on. Focus on improving your professional skills and groom them and then move on. Company has a good brand value and it should stay like this for another year (maximum - 2018 end). It will add value to your profile/resume.

If you are coming from a Top employer / Top college - They will try to lure you by benefits/money. Don't be lured. It will be a drop in your career. You won't grow professionally and why do you want to bring negativity in your system. This company might destroy your energy and your viewpoint about startups. You don't want to be here. Trust me.

+ Brand value of company is good in Middle East with its recent success in funding
+ Can be a good learning experience for someone between 1-3 years of experience. Note- Good learning experience for 1 year. After that it drops steeply.
+If you role is direct reporting to CEO/CFO/Senior Leadership, and you have a direct transparency of your work, you can grow faster if you know how to brand yourself
+Good to join for a small time and then you can switch to a better employer/startup like Careem","-Work Culture - There's no work culture to be honest. People are fired who object to Senior Management decisions/talks. Company is sales centric though it fakes itself to show people centric to employees.  There's no chemistry in the work culture. No one works to put their heart into company/work. People come, people work and they go back home when its time to leave. Everyone works in-silo. Zero coordination between teams and no one goes out of their way to help out people.

A lot of effort is spent on generation of fake PR while in actual the technology wing sucks bad. There are no HR policies and people have been fired in past citing performance related reasons while in actual there's no performance evaluation system in place. People are fired and exit the company behind back doors. You only get to know on their last working day.

Middle Management: One of the main reasons why this company is not a good place to work is because of 0 empowerment. The decisions are trickled from Senior leadership -> Bottom employees. Middle managers are the distributors of work and their view point is not at all taken into account (few are very close and trusted by leadership - The branding likeables). Key and critical decisions are taken behind doors and then forced upon employees. 

Quarterly meetings have awards given to random people which is decided in last 15-20 mins before the meetings. 

Technology- Technology teams are struggling badly. Some people have been brought from top employers and they are treated like Gods from heaven. There are people who are paid 2X,3X or even 5X just because they are poached from Top employers. They expect innovation and high productivity from these 5% of individuals. They’ve created an empire/hierarchy similar to historic era when Kings ruled the poor/farmers/needy people. The poor/farmers/needy people are the cost based hiring which they did initially and the wealthy are the recent recruits who are asked to rule them. Their product has numerous bugs and hardly anyone is Tech savvy in products/engineering teams. Hiring is totally random. You would see a core technical person poor in ethics/cultural point of view. Or a poor technical person with good work ethics and politeness. So everything is random. 

Company lacks heart and is struggling with its both Mission and Vision statement. 
Maybe its on a path to get acquired. All these factors contribute to an average company which is on a path to either become acquired or go extinct. Company is shown in media as very cool and tech centric but this is all fake. This is not where you would grow professionally as there are hardly any leaders in company.

empReview_37472556,"Oct 22, 2020",1.0,"There are still a handful of people left who are talented and a dream to work with. However, most of these are now in their notice period… 
It’s close to the metro.","This review is not meant as an attack on people or coming from a place of anger. This is purely so anyone applying to company can go in with open eyes and understand the current situation at company. Rather than a personal attack, it is more of a case that the wrong people have been put in the wrong jobs and previous experience has not been accounted for when hiring. 


Now where to even start..

The cons all stem from the leadership team, two people in particular.
The first is the CEO. There are two main problems here, his ego and that he actually has no power to make any decisions.
Previous employees have worked incredibly hard over the years to build fantastic and close-knit relationships with some of the biggest brands in fashion. However, one quick meeting between the brand and the company CEO can jeopardise that in as little as 15 minutes. His ego, lack of respect for anyone else and “company is bigger than any other brand” attitude, immediately destroys the mutual and strong partnerships that’s previously existed. 

Despite the title of CEO, the CEO has little power within the business. Instead, you will go back and forth on decisions, be asked to always “provide more information”, so he can bide his time as he isn’t actually sure what to do, or able to make the decision himself, before this is then decided by the chairman. The issue here is that decisions about the business are being made by people who are not involved in the day to day running of the company and heads of departments are not consulted, and so as you can imagine, more often than not, the wrong decisions are made. 

To hide the fact the CEO and CCO are unsure how to run the company and out of their depth, they have come up with a strategy. They are now slowly but surely allowing talented and experienced individuals leave and replacing them with timid and inexperienced people who become “yes men” for them. The teams under these new middle managers are left frustrated that they are now answering to people with less experience than them and with no backbone to stick up for the teams when needed. A simple look at the HR team will prove this point. The HR function may as well not exist in this company. 
Marketing is completely understaffed to the point where I am not sure you can call it a marketing department anymore. Jobs such as copy writing, an essential element to the business do not have a team and no importance is put on such a function when looking at team structure or hiring. 
The structures in all departments are also very top heavy. Within most teams, senior members of staff have been hired and there is little importance put on the more junior roles, even though these are the typically the ones doing the majority of the day to day work and ensuring the business is running. 

For those left with experience and with opinions, they are fighting a constant battle. For example, working with the CCO is nothing short of impossible. Despite having absolutely zero experience in running an online fashion company, he does not listen to the teams underneath him who have worked in this field their entire careers. If someone will push back on a task that they do not believe has substance or makes sense for the business they are told it is JFD (this means just do it, with other insulting words thrown in). Yes, this really is how a CCO speaks to staff at this company. 

Overall, the team are demotivated and over worked. They are demotivated as their leadership team has little or no experience and over worked as majority of the people who have left have not been replaced or replaced with someone who is more of a hindrance than a help. There is no respect for people’s personal time. Staff are expected to work 24/7 with trivial phone calls coming through at midnight.",0

Should you join company expect the following; 
- Be spoken to like you’re a five year old child
- Be micromanaged by the CEO who thinks he understands how to do your specific job better than you
- Receive unrealistic targets and deadlines 
- Incompetent HR (and prospective employee, that’s pretty important don’t you think?!)
- Regularly work OT with no recompense
- Have your personal phone taken over by multiple WhatsApp conversations buzzing throughout your Saturday, Sunday, Monday….. every night
- Work with colleagues, and report into managers completely unskilled and unqualified for their positions
- Likely be paid well under market value

Ever faced discrimination because of your gender? No? Join company!

Going back to last year, it was a fantastic place to work. Hosam was a respected CEO with an open door policy. He appreciated ideas and opinions from everyone, no matter what role they were in. Unfortunately this changed when parent company acquired company...

The company culture we were once proud of has been lost. The current atmosphere in the office is frosty, de-motivating and communication is at an all time low. Issues, questions and concerns have been raised to management in a recent “all hands business meeting” however these were avoided by our new CEO which left everyone speechless and even more de-motivated. He avoided key concerns and told everyone they would needed to write their own KPI’s and that a company wide bonus will be “looked into” for 2020, as well as answering a question on company culture and staff turnover with figures and an off topic answer on customer journey. 

Further to this our new CEO has a closed door policy at all times... you will find him in his glass office, disinterested in what everyone else is working on. He isn’t visible within the business, doesn’t like to be challenged and currently isn’t leading and inspiring the company staff. The top line management team also gives off the impression that they don’t know what’s going on which is adding to the demotivating atmosphere within the office. 

In light of the above, HR/Management need to implement some quick fixes to improve communication and bring back the company culture we all once loved before we loose any more key talented people! 

The following also needs to be reviewed ASAP: Company wide bonus - sooner than 2021 payout, Incentives and rewards - bring back thank you pizzas, company credit, etc, 
KPIs - without these what are we basing bonus and promotions on?  Low salaries - HR were working on a benchmarking project 6+ months ago yet nothing has been discussed since,  1 Flight per year - this has been in discussion for over 2 years now, company credit on your birthday - parent company employees get this yet company staff don’t?

Management team is incapable to run a business , in 18 months since parent company took over , 6 leaders changed for company. its like playing musical chair. Nobody knows who runs company currently. not even the employees who are working there . every month some random person from parent company will take their laptop and come and start working for company. No announcements are made even for major structural changes.. like if a new GM has joined & old GM was fired. You will not even know. the old GM will suddenly vanish one fine morning . they will not even give you chance for a proper sendoff. Employees are supposed to guess who is doing what . No communication with the team . suddenly some random posters will comeup in office with some crazy targets. without knowing the ground reality & no one from the team who is actually supposed to achieve these targets will have any idea on what these are or how to achieve these as they were not even consulted before setting these targets. The management has so much EGO , they are arrogant , Egotistical , Disrespectful & promote toxic work culture, The parent company CEO promotes a work culture where he praises a person who was replying to emails from the labor room while giving birth . in second example he praises a guy working at 4 am in the morning with his new born son on his lap on the day his son was born. !! how on earth is this a good thing ? you are certainly out of your mind if you create an environment , where employees are forced to work on these conditions. imagine the fear they have created that if you dont work like this you will be fired. would you like to work for a company or leader who promotes this kind of toxic work culture ? They think that all company employees are idiots ,they dont know how to do their jobs and should be fired. These are the exact words which were used by the parent company CEO on the 1st day of new office in front of the whole office. imagine the motivation of team members after that. They do exactly opposite of what they say in front of you. they said all company employees jobs will be safe. and the 1st thing they did was fired all the good performing employees & replaced them with their own puppets who dont even know anything about running an online fashion company. Friday is the firing day at company. every Friday someone will be fired. so if you get a meeting setup on a friday from HR that means its ur last day and instantly all your accounts will be blocked and your laptop taken back. id cards deactivated. this is how they offboard employees.",0

The company culture, frankly, is not conducive to inclusivity. Women are not given due attention, they are often interrupted during discussions, and promotions are less accessible to them, reminiscent of the situation in the U.S. several decades ago. Leadership lacks diversity, consisting mainly of middle-aged men from the MENA region with consulting backgrounds. This is not how you build a culture that fosters diverse perspectives and challenges the status quo. There's also an unnecessary urgency attached to everything, often resulting from inadequate planning, which is a breeding ground for mistakes. The structure is problematic too, with a top-heavy senior leadership, followed by a gap, and then a group of young individuals who may not yet fully understand professional life, yet are eager for significant titles. Mid-level management seems to be populated with individuals who simply comply, managed tightly by the leadership and spending significant time handling subpar talent. The engineering department is subpar and under-resourced, and the CTO, who spent his prime years at a more traditional company, seems to lack an understanding of the current landscape. In terms of user base, none of our products exceed half a million users. Uber took over our primary business, assimilated it, and the remainder has been largely abandoned. Lastly, the attrition rate is quite high, with intelligent, self-respecting individuals who have other options typically leaving within a year due to the sheer intensity of the work culture.",0

Unlimited number of leaves, in theory...","Work-Life Balance: A Figment of Imagination
At the parent company, work-life balance is fairy tale. Late night calls dragging you out of bed at 3-4 AM, not just once but several times a week… or night. The overall mentality of the company showed little little regard for employee well-being. Working weekends was encouraged, and blurring boundaries between personal life and work was celebrated. parent company's leadership seemed to take pride in how they could push you to work around the clock.Training and Teamwork: Mostly Missing
Certain senior colleagues were ill-mannered and exhibited condescending attitude. Needing support? Expect to be looked down upon with all charm of a grumpy old-school headmaster.Leadership: An Inspiration... to leave 
From mid-level management to very top, it was parade of uninspiring figures who excelled at putting unconstructive pressure on employees. parent company's leadership strategy: believe that employees are like machines—just push harder, and they’ll work faster only. Constant urgency created an atmosphere where panic was primary motivator. Just apply enough pressure, and stressed-out employees make mistakes faster than they can fix. It’s almost as if they thought that by cranking up the stress levels, they could squeeze out extra productivity. But hey, at least they managed to turn urgency into an art—just not the kind that results in anything useful…

Reorgs and Appraisals: Constant Fear
Reorgs were frequent, often feeling like imminent threat of being fired. Every reorg was like waiting for axe to fall, creating atmosphere of constant fear and insecurity. Appraisal cycles were no better, more a ritual of dread than a constructive review, ensuring everyone stayed on edge.

Employee Retention: Always hiring!
High attrition rate. I know teams that lost 4 out of 6 employees in less than two years. True testament of company’s work experience.

Toxic Environment: “Speak Up”… at Your Peril
Completing anonymous surveys can land you in management’s bad books. Rather than viewing feedback as tool for improvement, management preferred to play detective, trying to unmask brave souls who dared to voice negativity. Is brilliant strategy to ensure that employees feel valued and heard…",0
